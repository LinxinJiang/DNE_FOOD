## Inspiration
According to USDA:" food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply. This estimate, based on estimates from USDA's Economic Research Service of 31 percent food loss at the retail and consumer levels". What really shocked me was this is data back to 2010. 

I think the biggest problem is information asymmetry. Customers who are looking for affordable meals don't know where to go. The local restaurants that over-prepare food have to throw out the fresh meal.

## What it does
I want to create a platform for both customers and local restaurants. For customers, they can choose to order one night early or order one of the last few meals left from restaurants to save money. For local restaurants, if they know how many orders they will get the next day, they can only order just the right amount of ingredients. Additionally, many restaurants forced to throw the fresh food, if they can get some orders before they close then they can reduce the waste.

## How I built it
I was using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the website. I brainstormed for hours. I mainly consider how to let customers use our website. I decided to use the method that customers can save money for each meal, and give out free avocado. For restaurants, I think my website can bring them more customers and reduce costs. The way the website can continue to operate is to charge a certain fee from the restaurant.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
I believe this website can hope many people.

## What I learned
I learned how to add the map to my website. I thought it was very complicated to do. But after I did the research, it was easier than I thought.

## What's next for DNE
I want to add more functions. For example, customers can place an order from our website, and pick it up when they finish their work.
